# Introduction

This is a joint project between me and [Ghorthalon](https://github.com/Ghorthalon?tab=repositories) who did the initial AI work.

## How to use

You need ffmpeg installed and on your path.

On Windows you can use winget, choco, scoop...

On mac, use homebrew.

On Linux use your package manager.

## Running the project

This project uses Vite and npm, so simply run:

```bash
npm install
```

Then

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will run the Electron project.

You will need at least an API key for OpenAI.

Optionally you can also use an ElevenLabs key if you want to generate better speech tracks.
