# Introduction

This is a joint project between me and [Ghorthalon](https://github.com/Ghorthalon?tab=repositories) who did most of the AI work.

Basically this is a frontend to this project which lets you describe videos via AI.

I have high ambitious for this including the ability to describe a shared screen, etc.

we'll see how it goes, feel free to experiment.

As of June 9th this is still unfinished and only includes the settings UI - There is no hook between the settings and AI yet.
