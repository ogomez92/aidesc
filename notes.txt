Add clipboard tts model
add ARIA tts model

and display how many segments and usage statistics/cost it will need
continuous description mode where it uses tts or clipboard or whatever (not ARIA) to describe camera or shared screen with modifiable prompts.

how about we remove prompts from settings, and add them to the video processing screen and add checkbox to save them for future use. also we need a new prompt for continuous video and since there is no batch, advise users to put a prompt like describe what option is selected, etc.
in fact we could take most things away from settings and have them displayed in the video screen, like the batch window context etc and then in the processing video we can just add the relevant settings, then in continuous mode we do the same and add settings for that mode.

in continuous mode and batch mode there will be a record from cam button.
in continuous mode you should be able to update the prompt at will. See if it's possible not to describe if the app is focused.

test if ffmpeg is not installed create a link to some install resources like homebrew and winget.

we will need to have a stats display, to display the values that are not 0.

ensure that folders are cleaned up, in local temp

export as srt

get the new voie openAI apis to have a nice voie prompt.
get a way to make available models and voices in tts a combo box, possibly also for elevenlabs? but mainly OpenAI
have a helper class with getAvailableModels getAvailableVoices.

continous mode settings: prompt, capture image every, describe every, and method. No tts, just clipboard.
we really need to add some loading indicators.
por cierto, que se me olvidó antes decírtelo. Yo no tengo instalado ni ffmpeg ni ffprobe, y en el comprobador de depencencias me dice que efectivamente no tengo ffmpeg instalado pero para ffprobe se queda pillado el mensaje "checking ffprobe status install..."
